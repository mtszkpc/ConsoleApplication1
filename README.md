# Server
Server part of client-server app

This is simple client-server version of finding number game. To play it properly you should download 2 parts: client and server.
1. Run server app.
2. Run x clients you'd like to play.
3. Write number of clients in server console.
4. Use client console to find right number.

You can also run this app on 2 computers (that's main goal of this app), but you should fit your ip addresses.
Remember also about connection between your computers (f.e. using wire).

(Also remember this "game" was created only to check how connection can look IRL).
